## Description

This is an open-source project that leverages OpenAI's APIs, React, Next.js, and TypeScript to generate short stories with images for children aged between 3-7

The project uses OpenAI to generate the text for the story and DALL-E to create an accompanying image. The application allows users to enter a brief prompt that the algorithm will use to generate the story. The output is a short story with an accompanying image that can be shared, printed, or saved.

## Why I Created This Project

I created this project to help parents, teachers, and caregivers create fun and engaging stories for young children. With so much of our lives moving online, I wanted to create a tool that would make it easy for people to generate stories for their kids that would help improve their reading skills, imagination, and creativity.
